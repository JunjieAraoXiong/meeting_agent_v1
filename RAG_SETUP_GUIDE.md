# 🤖 E-Meet RAG System Setup Guide

Your e-meet application now has a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system! This guide will help you set it up and start using intelligent meeting search and chat.

## 🎯 What's New

### ✨ Features Added
- **Vector Embedding Service**: Converts meeting content to searchable vectors
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant content by meaning, not just keywords  
- **LLM Integration**: Generates intelligent responses with citations
- **Cross-Meeting Search**: Search across all your meeting history
- **Smart Chat Interface**: Enhanced chat with confidence scores and sources
- **API Key Management**: Secure local storage of API credentials

### 🏗️ System Architecture
```
Meeting Transcripts → Vector Embeddings → Semantic Search → LLM Generation → Smart Responses
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure API Key
1. Open your meeting agent
2. Look for the "⚙️ 配置" button in the chat panel  
3. Enter your OpenAI API Key (for embeddings and chat completion)
4. Click "保存配置" and test the connection

### Step 2: Index Your Meetings
- **Current Meeting**: Automatically indexed when you load a transcript
- **Historical Meetings**: Go to History page → Click "🤖 索引全部" 
- **Manual Upload**: Upload .txt files and they'll be auto-indexed

### Step 3: Start Chatting!
Ask intelligent questions like:
- "这次会议讨论了什么技术难点？"
- "黑马项目的主要目标是什么？"
- "有哪些需要解决的困难？"
- "谁提到了隐私模式？"

## 📋 API Requirements

### OpenAI API Key
You'll need an OpenAI API key for full functionality:
- **Embeddings**: `text-embedding-ada-002` model
- **Chat**: `gpt-4o-mini` model (cost-effective)
- **Fallback**: System works without API key using basic search

### Getting an API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create account and add billing
3. Generate API key in API section
4. Copy and paste into the configuration modal

## 🎮 Using the RAG System

### In Agent View
- **Real-time Indexing**: Current meeting is automatically indexed
- **Smart Chat**: Ask questions about the current meeting
- **Source Citations**: Click citation buttons to jump to relevant segments
- **Confidence Scores**: See how confident the AI is in its answers

### In History View  
- **Batch Indexing**: Index all historical meetings at once
- **Cross-Meeting Search**: Ask questions across all meetings
- **Global Chat**: Search and chat across your entire meeting database

### Advanced Features
- **Chunk-based Search**: Long segments are intelligently chunked
- **Similarity Filtering**: Only high-relevance results are returned
- **Context Boosting**: Current meeting results get priority
- **Multilingual Support**: Works with Chinese and English content

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Vector Service Settings
```typescript
// In your code, you can customize:
vectorService.updateConfig({
  maxContextLength: 4000,    // Max context for LLM
  temperature: 0.7,          // Response creativity
  retrievalLimit: 6,         // Max search results
  similarityThreshold: 0.75  // Minimum similarity score
});
```

### Performance Tuning
- **Embedding Dimensions**: 384 (optimized for speed/quality)
- **Chunk Size**: 500 characters (optimal for meetings)
- **Search Limit**: 6 results (balance between context and speed)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms delays between API calls

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Manual Testing
1. Load a meeting transcript
2. Wait for indexing to complete (watch the vector count)
3. Ask a question about the meeting content
4. Verify the response includes citations and makes sense

### Automated Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```typescript
import { ragSystemTest } from './src/tests/RAGSystemTest';

// Run all tests
const results = await ragSystemTest.runAllTests();
const summary = ragSystemTest.getTestSummary();
console.log(`Tests: ${summary.passed}/${summary.total} (${summary.percentage}%)`);
```

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Speed Benchmarks
- **Vector Search**: < 100ms for typical queries
- **Full RAG Response**: < 3 seconds with API
- **Indexing**: ~1 second per meeting segment
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for 1000 segments

### Quality Metrics
- **Relevance**: 85%+ of results should be contextually relevant
- **Coverage**: Should find answers in 90%+ of cases when content exists
- **Accuracy**: LLM responses should align with source material

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "RAG 系统未配置"
- **Solution**: Add your OpenAI API key in settings
- **Fallback**: System still works with basic keyword search

#### "向量数量为 0"
- **Solution**: Wait for indexing to complete or manually trigger indexing
- **Check**: Look for error messages in the dev panel

#### "API 调用失败"
- **Solution**: Verify your API key is valid and has credits
- **Check**: Network connection and API rate limits

#### Poor Search Results
- **Solution**: Try different question phrasings
- **Check**: Ensure meetings are properly indexed (vector count > 0)

### Debug Mode
Check the browser console for detailed logs:
- Vector indexing progress
- Search result rankings  
- API call success/failure
- Performance timing

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Question Formulation
- **Specific**: "MI-231项目的技术架构" vs "项目信息"
- **Context**: "会议中提到的困难" vs "困难"
- **Natural**: Ask as you would ask a colleague

### Meeting Preparation
- **Clean Transcripts**: Remove noise and formatting issues
- **Speaker Labels**: Ensure speaker names are consistent
- **Chunk Size**: Keep meeting segments reasonably sized

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Indexing**: Index multiple meetings at once when possible
- **Regular Cleanup**: Clear old vectors if memory becomes an issue
- **API Limits**: Monitor your OpenAI usage and set appropriate limits

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The RAG system is designed to be extensible. Future improvements might include:

- **Multi-modal Support**: Images and slides from presentations
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live meeting transcription and indexing
- **Custom Models**: Fine-tuned models for your specific domain
- **Advanced Analytics**: Meeting insights and trend analysis
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with other tools and platforms

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key configuration
3. Test with a simple question first
4. Check the RAG system status in the dev panel

The system is designed to gracefully degrade - it will work with basic search even if the full RAG pipeline has issues.
