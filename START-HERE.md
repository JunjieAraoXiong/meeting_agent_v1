# 🎯 **E-Meet: START HERE**

## 🔥 **Quick Test Your Transcriptions** (Recommended)

### **Option 1: Enhanced File Manager** (Auto-loads everything)
```bash
open demos/enhanced-file-manager.html
```
✅ **Automatically includes ALL files from `transcriptions/` folder!**
- `20250630.txt` and `20250703.txt` are pre-loaded
- Editable file names, sizes, dates
- Real-time performance analysis
- File tabs for easy switching

### **Option 2: Simple Testing** (Manual upload)
```bash
open demos/chinese-agent.html
```
1. Click "📁 加载文件" (Load File)
2. Select `20250630.txt` or `20250703.txt`  
3. Watch it parse your Feishu meeting format!

## 🏆 **Full Experience** (If you have Node.js)

```bash
# Install Node.js first: https://nodejs.org/
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📊 **Performance Testing**

To check how well it performs with your files:

1. **Quick test:** Use the chinese-agent above
2. **Detailed test:** Open `demos/prototypes/performance-test.html`
3. **Browser DevTools:** F12 → Performance tab while loading files

## 🧩 **What's What**

- **Chinese Agent** = Standalone HTML that works with your .txt files
- **Feishu Meeting Agent** = The same thing, just the React version  
- **Your Files** = Already in perfect format! (`transcriptions/*.txt`)

## ✅ **Expected Results**

Your files should:
- ✅ Parse in < 1 second
- ✅ Show timeline with speakers (汤欣钰, 说话人 1, etc.)
- ✅ Extract terms and allow clicking for definitions
- ✅ Enable chat queries about the meeting content

## 🚨 **If npm doesn't work**

That's fine! Just use the standalone version:
```bash
open demos/chinese-agent.html
```

---

**🎯 TL;DR: Open `demos/chinese-agent.html` in your browser and test with your transcription files!**
