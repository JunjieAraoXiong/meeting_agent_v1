- ✅ Optimized file upload for mobile
- ✅ Fast loading on slower connections

## 🔧 API Configuration for Web

### For Public Deployment
```typescript
// Users can configure their own API keys
// Keys are stored locally in browser
// No server-side storage needed
```

### For Private/Team Use
```typescript
// Option 1: Environment variables (build time)
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY;

// Option 2: Server proxy (recommended for production)
// Set up a backend to proxy API calls
```

## 🎮 Interactive Features on Web

### Real-time RAG Chat
- **Smart Questions**: Natural language queries
- **Live Citations**: Click to jump to transcript segments  
- **Confidence Scores**: Visual feedback on answer quality
- **Cross-Meeting Search**: Query across all uploaded meetings

### File Management
- **Drag & Drop**: Upload multiple transcript files
- **Auto-Processing**: Automatic term extraction and indexing
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time processing stats
- **Export/Import**: Save and restore your data

### Visual Enhancements
- **Status Indicators**: RAG system health and progress
- **Loading States**: Smooth animations during processing
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for any issues
- **Dark/Light Modes**: (Ready for future enhancement)

## 🚀 Performance on Web

### Optimizations Included
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load as needed
- **Efficient Chunking**: Smart text segmentation
- **Local Caching**: Vectors stored in browser memory
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Fast initial load

### Expected Performance
- **Initial Load**: < 3 seconds
- **File Processing**: ~1 second per meeting
- **Search Queries**: < 500ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for large datasets

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- ✅ **Local Storage**: Keys never sent to servers
- ✅ **No Logging**: API keys not logged anywhere
- ✅ **User Control**: Users manage their own keys
- ✅ **Fallback Mode**: Works without keys using basic search

### Data Privacy
- ✅ **Client-Side**: All processing happens in browser
- ✅ **No Upload**: Meeting data stays local
- ✅ **Optional API**: Can work completely offline
- ✅ **Export Control**: Users control their data

## 🎯 Testing Your Deployment

### Smoke Tests
1. **Load Test**: Upload a transcript file
2. **Search Test**: Try a basic keyword search
3. **RAG Test**: Configure API and ask an intelligent question
4. **Mobile Test**: Check on phone/tablet
5. **Performance Test**: Monitor browser DevTools

### User Acceptance Tests
1. **Upload Meeting**: Can users easily upload transcripts?
2. **Find Information**: Can they find specific meeting details?
3. **Smart Chat**: Do RAG responses make sense?
4. **Citations Work**: Do links jump to correct segments?
5. **Error Recovery**: What happens when API fails?

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Built-in Metrics
- **Vector Count**: How many segments indexed
- **Query Response Time**: Search performance
- **Confidence Scores**: Answer quality metrics
- **Error Rates**: API failure tracking

### Browser DevTools
- **Console Logs**: Detailed operation logging
- **Network Tab**: API call monitoring  
- **Performance Tab**: Resource usage tracking
- **Application Tab**: Local storage inspection

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Web Issues

### Common Problems

#### "Failed to fetch transcriptions"
- **Cause**: CORS issues with local files
- **Solution**: Use the HTTP server (running on :8000)
- **Alternative**: Upload files manually

#### "API Key Invalid"
- **Cause**: Incorrect or expired OpenAI key
- **Solution**: Regenerate key at platform.openai.com
- **Fallback**: System works without key using basic search

#### "Slow Performance"
- **Cause**: Large files or slow browser
- **Solution**: Use smaller chunks, clear cache
- **Monitor**: Browser DevTools Performance tab

#### "Mobile Layout Issues"
- **Cause**: Small screen, touch interaction
- **Solution**: All versions are mobile-optimized
- **Test**: Try landscape orientation
